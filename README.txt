## Speed Catch
A reaction-time game where players catch a decelerating ball.  
**Features**:
- Real-time leaderboard with Firebase
- Dynamic physics with speed decay
- Three-attempt challenge system

Notice how the ball physics feel natural due to delta-time calculations

The leaderboard updates in real-time across all devices

I implemented a configurable difficulty system that affects core game parameters
